#### My first Gulp Task Runner
gulp-connect-uglify
===================

Run
````
gulp
````


Looks like Gulp is developer friendly than Grunt; although Grunt's community is huge than Gulp. Gulp's community is fastly growing and I think Gulp vs. Grunt is a preference.

I may be doing my test task using Gulp for next experiements.
